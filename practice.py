"""
Great work! You've covered a lot in these exercises. Last but not least, let's write a function to find the median of a list.

The median is the middle number in a sorted sequence of numbers.

Finding the median of [7,12,3,1,6] would first consist of sorting the sequence into [1,3,6,7,12] and then locating the middle value, which would be 6.

If you are given a sequence with an even number of elements, you must average the two elements surrounding the middle.

For example, the median of the sequence [7,3,1,4] is 3.5, since the middle elements after sorting the list are 3 and 4 and (3 + 4) / (2.0) is 3.5.

You can sort the sequence using the sorted() function, like so:

sorted([5, 2, 3, 1, 4])
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
"""
def median(some_list):
    sorted_list = sorted(some_list)
    for i in sorted_list:
        if len(sorted_list) % 2 != 0:
            return sorted(sorted_list)[len(sorted_list)/2]  # Floor division is default in Python 2; Python 3 requires //.
        else:
            return float(sum(sorted_list[(len(sorted_list)/2)-1:(len(sorted_list)/2)+1]))/2.0

print median([1,1,2])
print median([7,3,1,4])
