# Good! Now let's take another look at list comprehensions.
# squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]

# Great! Next up: list slicing.

# start, end, stride = 1, 6, 2
# str[start:end:stride]

# You can think of a Python string as a list of characters.
# The string in the editor is garbled in two ways:
# First, our message is backwards;
# Second, the letter we want is every other letter.
# Use list slicing to extract the message and save it to a variable called message.

# Last but not least, let's look over some lambdas.
# my_list = range(16)
# filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, my_list)
# We've given you another (slightly different) garbled. Sort it out with a filter() and a lambda.

# Create a new variable called message.
# Set it to the result of calling filter() with the appropriate lambda that will filter out the "X"s.
# The second argument will be garbled.
# Finally, print your message to the console.
garbled = "IXXX aXXmX aXXXnXoXXXXXtXhXeXXXXrX sXXXXeXcXXXrXeXt mXXeXsXXXsXaXXXXXXgXeX!XX"
